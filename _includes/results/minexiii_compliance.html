<h4>MINEX III Compliance</h4>
<ol>
	<li><a id="1"></a>Functionality: the submission passes MINEX III validation, which includes limits on algorithm speed, memory consumption, runtime, etc.,
		<ol type="a">
			<li><a id="1a"></a>An exemption is made for template generators that successfully passed the Ongoing MINEX validation prior to the start of MINEX III.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li><a id="2"></a>Interoperability: all MINEX III-compliant template matchers match templates from the submitted template generator with a FNMR &le; 10<sup>-2</sup> at FMR &le; 10<sup>-2</sup> (PIV Level 1),</li>
	<li><a id="3"></a>Interoperability: a template matcher is submitted and it matches templates from all MINEX III-compliant template generators with a FNMR &le; 10<sup>-2</sup> at FMR &le; 10<sup>-2</sup> using two fingers (PIV Level 1),</li>
	<li><a id="4"></a>Accuracy at operationally-typical FMR: a template matcher is submitted and it matches its corresponding template generator's templates with a FNMR &le; (2 x 10<sup>-2</sup>) at FMR &le; 10<sup>-4</sup> using one finger (PIV Level 2),
		<ol type="a">
			<li><a id="4a"></a>An exemption is made for PIV-compliant template generators from Ongoing MINEX.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li><a id="5"></a> Compliance with minutia placement standards: minutiae density plots derived from generated templates do not exhibit a periodic, grid-like, or geometric structure without reasonable justification,</li>
	<li><a id="6"></a>History: the validation package was submitted within the last 5 years,
		<ol type="a">
			<li><a id="6a"></a>An exemption is made for PIV-compliant template generators from Ongoing MINEX.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li><a id="7"></a>Diversity of operating points: a template matcher is submitted and produces at least 512 unique scores over the entire dataset when comparing fingerprint templates from two different subjects,</li>
	<li><a id="8"></a>Availability: the submission is one of two submissions from the submitting organization, or its subsidiaries, acquisitions, or mergers, by first replacing submissions with the same CBEFF Product IDs and older version numbers, followed by replacing submissions with older acceptance dates.
		<ol type="a">
			<li><a id="8a"></a>A deviation is made for submissions exempted by 1a, 4a, or 6a. Once any MINEX III submission is received by an organization or the organization's subsidiaries, acquisitions, or mergers, all exempted submissions from the submitting organization, and the organization's subsidiaries, acquisitions, and mergers will lose their exemption, regardless of the submission's compliance status.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li><a id="9"></a>As of 08 March 2021, comparisons are not performed for algorithms that where a comparison algorithm was submitted, but the template generation algorithm was not compliant. <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/list.nist.gov/g/minex/c/2MFo676xjDM/m/yIxBXTfPAQAJ">See the announcement</a> for more details.</li>
